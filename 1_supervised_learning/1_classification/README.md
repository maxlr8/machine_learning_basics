This notebook tests the different performances of classification algorithms on a simple dataset called Social Network Advertisements containing various financial details of the customers, and also specifies if a customer bought the advertised product or not.

The following classification models have been tested:

1. __Logistic Regression Classifier__ <br>
2. __Naive Bayes Classifier__ <br>
3. __K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier__ <br>
4. __Decision Tree Classifier__ <br>
5. __Random Forest Classifier__ <br>
6. __Support Vector Machine Classifier__ <br>
